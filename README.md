# Raman-and-Photoluminescence-Analysis
A Matlab toolkit that can be used to baseline and peak fit both Raman and Photoluminescence spectra for a variety of 2D materials (currently graphene, phosphorene, and MoS2).

For instructions, please see particular subfolders.

Currently available:

1. Graphene - Raman

2. Phosphorene (aka black phosphorus) - Raman 

3. MoS2 - Raman
