# MoS2 Raman

Instructions:

1. Place 'MoS2RamanBaselineandFit.m' and your data file into your current Matlab directory.

2. Import your data file as 2 separate 1xn doubles (1 for x values and 1 for y values) called 'xdata' and 'ydata'.

3. Run "MoS2RamanBaselineandFit(xdata,ydata)" from the Matlab command window (for more advanced options, see file comments).

4. The command window will output the intensities (a.u.), locations (cm-1), and half-widths at half-maximum (HWHM) for each peak in addition to a plot and data of the baselined spectrum.
